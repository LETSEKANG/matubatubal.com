 			<h1>FOOTBALL</h1>
 			<p>In 2009 at the age of 09, started playing soccer. <br>I was playing for EECYCO fc founded by Pitso Makhema.<br> That was from 2009 until 2015
 		<br>I was playing as a Goalkeeper also a captain for my team,<br> my teamates were calling me Itumeleng Khune.<br> That was when i started following Khune.<br>
 		With that team we won more that 10 tropies.<br>
 		 And i went fro trials to try my best of lucks and i had an oportunity<br> to play for Free State Stars,
 		but that was for a short period.<br> Due to my Mother not supporting sports i had to choose between soccer<br> and school and obviously i had to make them happy<br> and focus on my studies. 
 		After i matriculated i joined Sparks Fc<br> and i was playing as a center back and enough due to my performance<br> i got an oportunity to be a captain again. 
 		We won tropies. Took part in tournaments </p>
